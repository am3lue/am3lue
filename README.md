### 🚀 Featured Projects

1. **Automated Lawn Mower**  
   An Arduino-powered lawn mower prototype with autonomous navigation capabilities. Built with cost-effective components to enhance accessibility and efficiency.

2. **Hydroponics System**  
   A smart hydroponic system designed to monitor and control plant growth, incorporating real-time data collection and nutrient management.

3. **Water Billing System**  
   A real-time billing system where users can manage water usage via RFID cards, deducting balance as they dispense water. This system supports multiple access points and allows balance updates through a web app.

4. **Simple Timed Irrigation System**  
   An irrigation system integrating an RTC, a valve, and capacitive soil moisture sensors to ensure precise watering schedules for optimal plant health.

5. **Locally Hosted Balance Update Website**  
   Using NodeMCU and Arduino Mega, this project provides a Wi-Fi-enabled, locally hosted web interface for updating a balance variable stored in EEPROM. Perfect for quick and secure balance management.
